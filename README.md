# classroom-gamification
Tool to gamify your classroom with an online leaderboard 

The main data file with dummy data is a google sheet document ([link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mWH_DFhzaR49LRrwp9C1v50xThY7S6EReM69Ug8Dpks/edit?usp=sharing)).
You need to host your own file in google drive and then publish the final leaderboard chart.
